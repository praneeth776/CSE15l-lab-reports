# Lab Report5 - Week9

In this lab report, I will be playing the role of both the student and the TA. The student will post a bug in his code with the necessary details. The TA uses these details to debug the code and explain it to the student.  

## Student's Bug

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser,terminal/editor, and so on)?**


I am using a MacBook with macOS operationg system and VSCode editor for editing the code.

**Detail the symptom youʼre seeing. Be specific; include both what youʼre seeing and what
you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also
great. Avoid saying “it doesnʼt work”.**
